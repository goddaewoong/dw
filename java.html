    target="_blank" title="JavaScript speicification"><strong>ECMAScript (or ES)</strong></a> is a scripting-language specification standardized by Ecma International in ECMA-262 and ISO/IEC 16262.</p>
    <p>It was created to standardize JavaScript to help foster multiple independent implementations. JavaScript has remained the best-known implementation of ECMAScript since the standard was first published, with other well-known implementations including JScript and ActionScript.</p>

      <p>ECMAScript is commonly used for client-side scripting on the World Wide Web, and it is increasingly being used for writing server applications and services using Node.js.</p>
